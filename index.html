                    <p>My name is Justin Boers, I am 19 years old, and I am currently pursuing a Software Developer
                        level 4
                        program.</p>

                    <p>Educations </p>

                    <p> I started my schooling journey at the elementary level, attending Laurentiusschool in Delft. From
                        there, I continued on to Delfland, a secondary vocational school located in Delft, where I began to
                        focus on the technical aspect of education. This decision stemmed from my longstanding interest in
                        this field, eventually leading me to enroll in the Software Developer Level 4 program that I am
                        currently pursuing. </p>

                    <p>Work experience</p>

                    <p> I have gained a lot of work experience, ranging from working in the hospitality industry as a cook
                        to being employed in various retail positions. This diversity of experiences has acquainted me with
                        different work environments. My career began with a paper route, but I didn't continue it for long.
                        Afterwards, I started working in supermarkets as a regular employee. Subsequently, I also worked in
                        the hospitality industry and spent some time in the kitchen. During my school internship, I had the
                        opportunity to work at my internship company, which appealed to me due to my preference for this
                        field of work. Unfortunately, during this job, I had to perform various other tasks as well. Then, I
                        got the opportunity to work elsewhere and return to a retail environment as an employee, which I
                        also did.</p>
